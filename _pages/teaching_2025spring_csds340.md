# **CSDS340: Introduction to Machine Learning**

Xiaotian (Max) Han

Spring 2025, M/W 3:20–4:35 PM


## **Course Description**

This course provides an in-depth introduction to machine learning (ML) algorithms and their practical implementation. We will examine key learning settings, explore diverse algorithms, and learn how to implement and evaluate their performance. We will also discuss handling noise, missing values, and scalability challenges, as well as review common ML tools and libraries.
